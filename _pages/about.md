Hi, I am an **M.Phil. student** in AI Thrust of [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) of 3rd Cohort.

Currently, I am supervised by [Prof. Yutao YUE](https://ait.hkust-gz.edu.cn/archives/3729) and [Prof. Zhijiang GUO](https://cartus.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my **Honors B.Sc. in Statistics** from [HONGSHEN Honors School](https://hshc.cqu.edu.cn/) of [Chongqing University](https://www.cqu.edu.cn/) in 2024, it was an amazing experience.

I mainly focus on *LLM Mechanism Interpretability* and *XAI*. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to [**contact**](mailto:jyang729@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn).
